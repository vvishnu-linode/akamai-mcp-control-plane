Idea Summary

November 2024: Anthropic drops MCP (Model Context Protocol) - a game-changer that lets AI assistants connect to ANY data source or tool. Suddenly, Claude can read your Jira tickets, Cursor can access your databases, CoPilot can pull from your APIs.

The explosion: 6.6M+ monthly downloads. 5,000+ MCP servers created. Every AI assistant racing to adopt it.

The problem: Every MCP server needs configuration. Every AI tool client needs separate setup. Every connection is a security risk.

MCP Control Plane is the command center for the MCP revolution. Think of MCP servers as power outlets and our platform as the circuit breaker panel - managing which AI gets access to what data, when, and how.

Why Akamai? MCP servers are the new API endpoints. They're how AI accesses your company's brain. And who better to secure and manage API-like infrastructure than Akamai? This positions us at the intersection of AI and enterprise data - exactly where the next decade's battles will be fought.

The window is TIGHT. OpenAI and Microsoft just adopted MCP. Every day without a management solution is another day enterprises delay MCP adoption.

Opportunity / Problem
MCP is revolutionary. It's also a security nightmare waiting to happen.

The MCP Configuration Hell (Developer Reality):

Building MCP server for Slack? Configure it in Claude. And Cursor. And Windsurf. Separately.

20 MCP servers across 5 AI tools = 100 configuration points

Each config file exposes credentials - your database passwords sitting in JSON files

Switch between work and personal? Manually swap MCP server configs every time

No idea which MCP servers are actually running or if they're working

The MCP Security Catastrophe (Enterprise Reality):

MCP servers are bridges between AI and your data. Unsecured bridges.

That harmless "MCP-Slack" server? It can read EVERY channel if misconfigured

No visibility: "Which AI tools are accessing our customer database via MCP?"

Shadow MCP usage: Developers spinning up servers without IT knowledge

Compliance nightmare: "Prove that MCP-postgres wasn't accessed by unauthorized AI tools"

The Multiplier Effect: One enterprise discovered 47 different MCP servers across teams:

12 connecting to the same database (different configs, different security levels)

8 Slack MCP servers (some reading channels they shouldn't)

Zero central oversight

"It's like giving everyone master keys and hoping they're careful"

Without management, MCP becomes the biggest backdoor in tech history.

Proposed Solution / Concept
One MCP Control Plane. Every server. Every tool. Secured.

For Developers (MCP Made Simple):

Universal MCP Registry: Define once, use everywhere. Your "mcp-jira" works in Claude, Cursor, and any future AI

Smart MCP Activation: Enter a project folder â†’ correct MCP servers auto-load. Git-aware context switching

MCP Credential Vault: No more API keys in config files. Credentials injected at runtime

MCP Debugging Console: See every request/response. Monitor which servers are actually being used

For Enterprises (MCP Under Control):

MCP Access Gateway: Every AI-to-MCP connection flows through your control plane

MCP Permission Matrix: "Claude can access mcp-docs but not mcp-financials"

MCP Audit Trail: Every query, every access, every byte transferred - logged and compliant

MCP Server Registry: Approved servers only. Block unauthorized MCP connections

Dynamic MCP Provisioning: New developer? Gets exactly the MCP servers their role needs

The Technical Magic:

Intercepts MCP protocol at transport layer

Authenticates every MCP request

Enforces policies in real-time

Works with ANY MCP client or server

Runs on Akamai's edge - millisecond latency

The Akamai MCP Advantage: We're not building another MCP server. We're building the infrastructure that makes 1,000s of MCP servers enterprise-ready. It's the difference between having smart home devices and having a smart home system.

The Pitch: "Remember when APIs went wild and everyone needed API management? MCP is that moment for AI. Be the Akamai of the AI era."
